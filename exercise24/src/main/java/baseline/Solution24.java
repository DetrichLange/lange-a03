Create a program that compares two strings and determines if the two strings are anagrams. The program should prompt
for both input strings and display the output as shown in the example that follows.
    Implement the program using a function called isAnagram, which takes in two words as its arguments and returns true or false. Invoke this function from your main program.
    Check that both words are the same length.
