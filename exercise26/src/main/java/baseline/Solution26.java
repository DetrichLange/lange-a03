Write a program that will help you determine how many months it will take to pay off a credit card balance. The program
should ask the user to enter the balance of a credit card, the APR of the card, and their monthly payment. The program
should then return the number of months needed (rounded up to the next integer value).
The formula for this is
n = -(1/30) * log(1 + b/p * (1 - (1 + i)^30)) / log(1 + i)
where
n is the number of months.
i is the daily rate (APR divided by 365).
b is the balance.
p is the monthly payment.
    Prompt for the cardâ€™s APR. Do the division internally.
    Prompt for the APR as a percentage, not a decimal.
    Use a class called PaymentCalculator with a public method called calculateMonthsUntilPaidOff, which takes no
    parameters and returns the number of months.
    Round fractions of a cent up to the next cent for internal calculations
